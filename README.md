I started volunteering for Youth's Voice , when I noticed that their database was in xlsx format, and the person in charge of creating the id card numbers, was doing it by hand. And so I decided to volunteer to create the id card numbers using python. Less time consuming, less chance of error. 

Libraries: xlsxwriter, xlrd, pandas.

I have uploaded a dummy database, where the columns are: Full Name- Year They Joined The Organization - City - Birth Date
